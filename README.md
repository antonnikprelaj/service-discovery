# Microservices: API Gateways and Service Discovery in Nx and NestJs

This article intention is to give you a broader perspective into the Microservices architecture. There's many people out there claiming they have a Microservice oriented architecture but they lack of the core concepts on which this pattern relies. My goal is to write a set of articles looking to clear all the fog that appears when shifting from monolithic to highly distributed application.

The Microservices world is full of interesting and incredibly hard to implement stuff. When you get started you think that by just dividing your app in multiple services you are already there. Sadly, that's almost never true. It's more common than you think to see people building highly critical apps in this way without having in place all the core concepts.

In this article I'm going to focus in two patterns API Gateway and Service Discovery. If you are doing Microservice architecture you **SHOULD** know these two pretty well, being that the case use this article to make sure you have clear knowledge on these concepts. If you are enterily new to Microservices, have fun and enjoy the ride.
